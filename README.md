# Countdown Timer Website 
See this repo live at https://asiabthetechie.github.io/birthday-countdown-timer/

This project creates the base files for a simple countdown timer website using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to the timer there's a email input that would allow people to sign up to get a invitation.
This project is one of ten projects made to act as a beginner/refresher to the fundamentals of web programming. 
Countdown timers can be used for national or international events (for example, new year or a certain holiday), specific business events (for example, a product launch or a important sale), or personal events (for example, wedding dates or birthdays).
